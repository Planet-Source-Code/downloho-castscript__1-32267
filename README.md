### Description

The Customize And Save Time Scripting language is used along the same lines as JavaScript; it is embedded in the HTML code. The script defines tags and their properties, then implants them into the HTML source via the tags' name. I was constantly getting tired of continually writing and and re-writing the same lines of code in HTML; and I wondered how I could use a scripting language to define tags that could be reused over and over again. CastScript is what I came up with.
